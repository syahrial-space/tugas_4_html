    <h1>Halaman 4 - MOTO GP</h1>
    <h3>Dovizioso: the attendance king</h3>

    <p align="right">The Italian, along with teammate Jorge Lorenzo, has been competing on the
      World stage for 16 straight years - the third highest on the grid behind
      Valantino Rossi (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP). and Dani Pedrosa(Repsol Honda Team).
      It's a huge testament to the 32-year-old, who in the last two years has
      been - on paper - Marc Marquez'(Repsol HOnda Team) most consistent
      challenger.<p>
